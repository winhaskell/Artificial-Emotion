http://www.primaryobjects.com/2016/10/24/emotional-artificial-intelligence/

In this article, we’re going to build a proof-of-concept program, capable of simulating emotion in software,

using artificial intelligence, measuring and reacting to conversational emotions such as love and hate, 
and developing longer relationships between human and computer. 
Does this seem far-fetched? Let’s give it a try!
